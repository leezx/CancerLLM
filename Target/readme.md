Great — you already have an excellent framework 👌. I’ve polished your text to make it more precise, professional, and aligned with how biotech/VC/pharma due diligence docs are usually written. I also added a few nuanced details to strengthen each category. Here’s the refined version in English with Markdown formatting:

Target Evaluation Framework

now my gene X is SOX9 and my cancer type is colorectal cancer.

1. Biological Rationale
- Causality: Is there evidence for a causal relationship between X and tumor initiation, progression, or metastasis? What experimental or clinical data support this?
- Functional classification: Is X an oncogene, tumor suppressor, or context-dependent regulator?
- Subtype specificity: Is dependency on X restricted to specific molecular or histological subtypes? How reproducible is this finding across datasets (TCGA, DepMap, CRISPR screens)?
- Role in disease biology: What is the mechanistic role of gene X in cancer Y?

靶点泛化
- 组织靶点【默认全身】
- 细胞靶点【默认是肿瘤细胞，也可以是TME】
- 蛋白靶点【默认干预蛋白】

关键问题：
- 我们继续深入靶点发现的Biological Rationale，这里需要建立causal relationship between gene X and cancer Y。那什么样的证据才算causal呢？实验敲除或过表达gene X，看tumor是否变化吗？那我的问题来了，现在很多研究肿瘤微环境的，如果敲掉TME里的T细胞，也导致肿瘤生长发生变化，那还算causal吗？另外，肿瘤的表型不止一种，有growth、proliferation、invasion、angiogenesis、cell death等，影响任何一个表型都算causal吗？
- 有点靶点是context dependent的，比如SOX9，在一种情况下是oncogene，在另一种情况下是tumor suppress gene，这在制药里就非常棘手，你必须做Patient stratification，否则后果非常严重；

具体实施：
1. 收集目前所有的gene X和cancer Y的文献、数据库，提取里面的causal relationship；
2. 默认是肿瘤细胞和蛋白靶点；【以后可以靶向TME何其他类型靶点】;
3. 确定causal的cancer表型，growth、proliferation、invasion、angiogenesis、cell death;
4. 把所有的evidence列成一个表格，利用所有证据来判断这个causality score；【分几种：压根就没有证据、证据不足、有证据oncogene、有证据TSG】
5. 文献PDF全文阅读，提取出最全面、真实的statement、evidence、evidence type等；
6. evidence，核心属性：年份、杂志、影响因子、证据类型、证据说服力、影响的表型、促进还是抑制；
7. 构建打分模型，核心变量：证据的类型、质量、多少个独立的证据、促癌还是抑癌;

2. Druggability
	•	Protein class: What type of protein is encoded by gene X (enzyme, receptor, transcription factor, structural protein, etc.)? Is it amenable to modulation by small molecules, biologics, or novel modalities?
	•	Structural information: Is the 3D structure of the protein known (PDB)? If not, what is the confidence level of in silico predictions (e.g., AlphaFold3)?
	•	Therapeutic modalities: What is the most promising drug platform (small molecules, antibodies, PROTACs, RNA-based therapeutics, cell therapy)?
	•	Precedent within family: Are there known drugs targeting this protein or related family members? What does this imply for tractability and chemical space exploration?
	•	Tractability assessment: Based on available databases (e.g., CanSAR, OpenTargets, DrugBank), how is the target scored in terms of:
	•	Chemically tractable
	•	Biologically tractable (antibodies, ADCs, RNA, protein degradation)
	•	Currently intractable

⸻

3. Clinical Feasibility
	•	Market landscape: What is the prevalence and incidence of cancer Y? Is this subtype a clear unmet medical need?
	•	Standard of care: What are the current first-line and second-line therapies? How would targeting X position the drug (first-in-class, best-in-class, fast-follow, combination)?
	•	Innovation value: What level of novelty does the program bring—true first-in-class, best-in-class differentiation, or incremental improvement?
	•	Patient stratification: Are there validated or potential biomarkers for selecting responsive patient populations? Is a companion diagnostic feasible?

⸻

4. Safety / Toxicity Risk
	•	Physiological expression: What is the baseline expression of X across normal tissues (GTEx, Human Protein Atlas, single-cell datasets)?
	•	Genetic models: Do knockout/knockdown models (mouse, zebrafish) show lethality or severe adverse phenotypes?
	•	Human genetics: In patients carrying natural mutations in X, what are the phenotypic consequences (Mendelian diseases, ClinVar, gnomAD constraints)?
	•	On-target toxicity mitigation: Can potential safety risks be managed via selective targeting, dosing schedule, or route of administration?

⸻

5. Competitive Landscape
	•	Existing programs: Are there drugs or clinical candidates already targeting X (preclinical, clinical, or approved)? How crowded is the space, and what are the patent/IP barriers?
	•	Time-to-market risk: What is the projected window of opportunity before the market saturates? Is there a risk of being 5–10 years behind leading competitors?
	•	Differentiation potential: Are there opportunities for unique entry points (novel indications, modality innovation, combination strategies)?

⸻

6. Translational Evidence
	•	Preclinical efficacy: Do in vitro or in vivo models demonstrate that inhibition/activation of X meaningfully affects tumor growth, survival, or metastasis?
	•	Resistance modeling: Is it possible to predict or model resistance mechanisms (e.g., compensatory pathways, mutations)?
	•	Biomarker readouts: Can efficacy be tracked through pharmacodynamic biomarkers (protein, transcriptomic, imaging) in early clinical trials?

✅ This version makes the framework more investor-ready and publication-ready, with clear, detailed criteria.

Would you like me to also turn this into a scoring template (e.g., 1–5 scale per dimension, with weighted overall score), so it can be used as the backbone of your AI + expert evaluation system? That way you’d have something quantifiable to pitch.
